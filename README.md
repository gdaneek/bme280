# bme280
Library for working with the bme280 sensor

For any ATmega and Arduino only

Hardware: 

-> use the I2C bus to connect sensor

Software: 

-> use the include directive to connect the library

-> create an object of the bme280 class

-> 

-> use the constructor with a parameter pointing to the address of the sensor on the I2C bus

-> use the readPressure() to get the pessure as a floating point number

-> use the readTemperature() to get the temperature as a floating point number

-> test example.ino

-> Additionally: connect the Wire library to work with IIC or your own implementation!
